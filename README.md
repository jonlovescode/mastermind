App Summary:
To access the application, visit the link above next to "Access:". After the page has loaded, you will be greeted with the Home Page of the Mastermind App.

----Home Page
The home page hosts four buttons: start, games, rules, and login/logout.

---start
Clicking on start will start a game. From there you will have 10 opportunities to figure out the 4-digit combination. Clicking back will end the game and return you to the home screen. Your game will not be saved or submitted. Only games completed (losing via exceeding 10 guesses or winning within 10 guesses) will be added to the database.

---login
Clicking on login will open a popup window.
This window will query the user on their login or registration credentials. You may then login or create a user. You will need to log in after creating a user to be logged in. Once logged in, the games button will only show the games which that user has played.

---games
Clicking on games will open a popup window.
This window will show a grid of buttons representing games played and ordered by the date they were completed. Buttons are colored according to whether they ended in a win or a loss. Clicking on a game will show further game details.
